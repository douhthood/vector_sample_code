# C# Vector Demos

This sample code uses OpenAI and Cohere to create vectors via their public REST endpoints.
The C# code acts as a REST client, for the OpenAI and Cohere REST servers.
The C# code parses the JSON response and extracts the relevant vectors.

The sample programs are:
- [Vectorize the table with OpenAI](OpenAI_VectorizeTable.cs)
- [Similarity Search with OpenAI](OpenAI_SimilaritySearch.cs)
- [Vectorize the table with Cohere](Cohere_VectorizeTable.cs)
- [Similairty Search with Cohere](Cohere_SimilaritySearch.cs)
